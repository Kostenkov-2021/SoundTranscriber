<h1 id="sound-transcriber-user-guide-">Sound Transcriber User Guide.</h1>
<p>This user guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Sound Transcriber and help you make the most of its features.</p>
<p>We highly recommend reading this guide to ensure optimal usage of the program.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-sound-transcriber">Introduction to Sound Transcriber</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber is an accessible audio-to-text conversion program designed to transcribe audio and video files, it offers support for extracting subtitle files and more.</p>
<p>Developed by Mahmoud Atef, Ahmed Bakr, and Qais Alrefai from the TecWindow team.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion of audio and video files to text using various transcription services.</li>
<li>Saving conversion results as .txt and .doc files or as .SRT subtitle files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planned-features-">Planned features:</h2>
<p>We have several planned features in the pipeline, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation of conversion results into multiple languages.</li>
<li>Spell check functionality with dictionaries.</li>
<li>Conversion of results into audio using text-to-speech engines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supported-services-">Supported services:</h2>
<p>The software currently only supports online conversion using Google&#39;s speech recognition, OpenAi&#39;s Whisper, and Meta&#39;s wit.ai.</p>
<h2 id="important-notes-">Important notes:</h2>
<p>Please take note of the following important information:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the program uses the Google service. To utilize other services, you need to obtain an API key from the respective service provider.</li>
<li>For the best results with Arabic language transcription, we recommend using wit.ai.</li>
<li>OpenAI&#39;s Whisper has been included based on previous experiences, but it may not function as intended or may not work at all. We appreciate your feedback and experiences to help us resolve any issues.</li>
<li>Unlike OpenAI, Wit.ai provides free API keys.</li>
<li>When converting a file, ensure that you select the appropriate language before initiating the conversion process. If a file is multilingual, words in languages other than the selected language may not be accurately converted due to limitations of the services.</li>
<li>Prior to conversion, files are split into segments of up to 60 seconds, depending on the limitations of each service. Consequently, some words may be lost during this process. To achieve optimal results, we recommend adjusting the segment duration based on the silence time, file length, and segment duration allowed by each service.</li>
<li>For optimal results with .srt files, we recommend selecting a short duration, such as 5 seconds, for the segments.</li>
<li>Sound Transcriber requires <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable X64</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/highdpimfc2013x64enu">Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable X64.</a> If the program does not work for you, please use the previous links to download and install the required files.</li>
<li>Currently, Sound Transcriber supports the following languages: Arabic, English, Spanish, French, Russian and Turkish.</li>
<li>Sound Transcriber is compatible with Windows 8 and above, but only in 64-bit systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supported-file-extensions-">Supported file extensions:</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber supports the following file extensions for conversion:</p>
<p>.mp3, .wav, .aac, .flac, .oga, .opus, .mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov, .m4a, .ogg, .ram, .rm, .wma, .wmv, .3gp, .flv.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-api-keys-">Obtaining API Keys:</h2>
<h3 id="wit-ai-">Wit.ai:</h3>
<p>If we were to include an API key within the program itself, it would likely be blocked after widespread usage by multiple users.
Moreover, wit.ai provides distinct API keys for each language. This means that you need to create an application in the desired language and obtain its corresponding API key.
Unfortunately, it is not feasible for us to gather API keys for all languages since they vary based on individual preferences.
Therefore, we will provide you with instructions on how to obtain your own private API key.
Although the following steps may appear extensive, they are straightforward and only need to be completed once.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <a href="https://wit.ai">wit.ai website</a></li>
<li>Log in with your Meta account by clicking &quot;Continue with Meta.&quot;</li>
<li>Follow the normal account creation steps or press &quot;Continue with Facebook&quot;</li>
<li>Go to the top of the page, press h or 1 for screen reader users.</li>
<li>Click &quot;New App&quot; and give the app any English name, such as test or my app.</li>
<li>You will find an options box for the app&#39;s language, open it and choose the appropriate language. The audio files will be converted to the language you choose.</li>
<li>Finally click &quot;Create&quot;.</li>
<li>Find the name of the application you created, click on it, and then navigate to the &quot;Management&quot; button.</li>
<li>When you reach this button, press the letter b to find a button called Settings. Press this button.</li>
<li>Move with the number 4 or h for screen reader users until you find a heading called Client Access Token, scroll down and you will find your key as a button. You can select the text manually to copy it or press the same button to for it to be automatically copied.</li>
<li>Return to Sound Transcriber and paste your API key into the provided field.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can repeat these steps and create a new application with a different name to obtain an API key for transcribing in another language. If you want to use multiple languages with wit.ai, simply repeat the steps to obtain an API key for each language.</p>
<h3 id="whisper-">Whisper:</h3>
<p>Sound Transcriber supports transcription through the use of OpenAI&#39;s Whisper API keys, which are not available for free.</p>
<p>The pricing is based on the number of characters transcribed, and specific plans are not mentioned here.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-translate-">How to Translate:</h2>
<p>While Sound Transcriber currently supports only a limited number of languages in its interface options and user guide, it can transcribe speech to text in a wide array of languages.</p>
<p>However, we warmly welcome anyone interested in translating the program into their native language.</p>
<p>The translation of interface options primarily relies on .po files, which can be edited using the Poedit program. You can download Poedit from its official website, then navigate to the Sound Transcriber repository on GitHub or locate the program folder on your device. Next, locate the messages.pot file and open it in Poedit. From there, you can translate the strings into your preferred language, save the file (which will generate both a .po and a .mo file), and share these files with us.</p>
<p>Sound Transcriber can recognize and accommodate new translations, allowing you to test your translation before submitting it to us. To do this, navigate to the Languages folder, create a folder with the code for your language (the first two letters of the language), then create a subfolder named LC_MESSAGES, and place the .po and .mo files inside. Don&#39;t forget to name the files as SoundTranscriber.po and SoundTranscriber.mo.</p>
<p>While translation of the user guide and Sound Transcriber updates is not obligatory, you have the option to translate the Markdown files available on GitHub in the Sound Transcriber repository and then share them with us.</p>
<p>If you choose not to translate the User Guide and Updates file, Sound Transcriber will display them in English.</p>
<p>Software translation is an ongoing effort, and we will liaise with you before releasing new updates so you can translate any new content.</p>
<h2 id="sound-transcriber-website-">Sound Transcriber website:</h2>
<p>While there is no official website for Sound Transcriber, you can access all necessary resources in the Sound Transcriber repository on gitHub. This repository contains translation files and the latest version of the program.</p>
<p>Note: Sound Transcriber is not open source at this time, and the repository does not contain the source code for the program.</p>

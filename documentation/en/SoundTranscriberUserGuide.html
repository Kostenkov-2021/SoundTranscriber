<h1 id="sound-transcriber-user-guide-">Sound Transcriber User Guide.</h1>
<p>This user guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Sound Transcriber and help you make the most of its features.</p>
<p>We highly recommend reading this guide to ensure optimal usage of the program.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-sound-transcriber">Introduction to Sound Transcriber</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber is an accessible audio-to-text conversion program designed to transcribe audio and video files, it offers support for extracting subtitle files and more.</p>
<p>Developed by Mahmoud Atef, Ahmed Bakr, and Qais Alrefai from the TecWindow team.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion of audio and video files to text using various transcription services.</li>
<li>Saving conversion results as .txt and .doc files or as .SRT subtitle files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planned-features-">Planned features:</h2>
<p>We have several planned features in the pipeline, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation of conversion results into multiple languages.</li>
<li>Spell check functionality with dictionaries.</li>
<li>Conversion of results into audio using text-to-speech engines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supported-services-">Supported services:</h2>
<p>The software currently only supports online conversion using Google&#39;s speech recognition, OpenAi&#39;s Whisper, and Meta&#39;s wit.ai.</p>
<h2 id="important-notes-">Important notes:</h2>
<p>Please take note of the following important information:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the program uses the Google service. To utilize other services, you need to obtain an API key from the respective service provider.</li>
<li>For the best results with Arabic language transcription, we recommend using wit.ai.</li>
<li>OpenAI&#39;s Whisper has been included based on previous experiences, but it may not function as intended or may not work at all. We appreciate your feedback and experiences to help us resolve any issues.</li>
<li>Unlike OpenAI, Wit.ai provides free API keys.</li>
<li>When converting a file, ensure that you select the appropriate language before initiating the conversion process. If a file is multilingual, words in languages other than the selected language may not be accurately converted due to limitations of the services.</li>
<li>Prior to conversion, files are split into segments of up to 60 seconds, depending on the limitations of each service. Consequently, some words may be lost during this process. To achieve optimal results, we recommend adjusting the segment duration based on the silence time, file length, and segment duration allowed by each service.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supported-file-extensions-">Supported file extensions:</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber supports the following file extensions for conversion:</p>
<p>.mp3, .wav, .aac, .flac, .oga, .opus, .mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov, .m4a, .ogg, .ram, .rm, .wma, .wmv, .3gp, .flv.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-api-keys-">Obtaining API Keys:</h2>
<h3 id="wit-ai-">Wit.ai:</h3>
<p>If we were to include an API key within the program itself, it would likely be blocked after widespread usage by multiple users.
Moreover, wit.ai provides distinct API keys for each language. This means that you need to create an application in the desired language and obtain its corresponding API key.
Unfortunately, it is not feasible for us to gather API keys for all languages since they vary based on individual preferences.
Therefore, we will provide you with instructions on how to obtain your own private API key.
Although the following steps may appear extensive, they are straightforward and only need to be completed once.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <a href="https://wit.ai">wit.ai website</a></li>
<li>Log in with your Meta account by clicking &quot;Continue with Meta.&quot;</li>
<li>Follow the normal account creation steps or press &quot;Continue with Facebook&quot;</li>
<li>Go to the top of the page, press h or 1 for screen reader users.</li>
<li>Click &quot;New App&quot; and give the app any English name, such as test or my app.</li>
<li>You will find an options box for the app&#39;s language, open it and choose the appropriate language. The audio files will be converted to the language you choose.</li>
<li>Finally click &quot;Create&quot;.</li>
<li>Find the name of the application you created, click on it, and then navigate to the &quot;Management&quot; button.</li>
<li>When you reach this button, press the letter b to find a button called Settings. Press this button.</li>
<li>Move with the number 4 or h for screen reader users until you find a heading called Client Access Token, scroll down and you will find your key as a button. You can select the text manually to copy it or press the same button to for it to be automatically copied.</li>
<li>Return to Sound Transcriber and paste your API key into the provided field.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can repeat these steps and create a new application with a different name to obtain an API key for transcribing in another language. If you want to use multiple languages with wit.ai, simply repeat the steps to obtain an API key for each language.</p>
<h2 id="whisper-">Whisper:</h2>
<p>Sound Transcriber supports transcription through the use of OpenAI&#39;s Whisper API keys, which are not available for free.</p>
<p>The pricing is based on the number of characters transcribed, and specific plans are not mentioned here.</p>

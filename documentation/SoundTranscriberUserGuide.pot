"This user guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of"
" Sound Transcriber and help you make the most of its features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We highly recommend reading this guide to ensure optimal usage of the "
"program."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Introduction to Sound Transcriber:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sound Transcriber is an accessible audio-to-text conversion program "
"designed to transcribe audio and video files, it offers support for "
"extracting subtitle files and more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Developed by Mahmoud Atef, Ahmed Bakr, and Qais Alrefai from the "
"TecWindow team."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Features:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sound Transcriber offers the following features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Conversion of audio and video files to text using various transcription"
" services."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Saving conversion results as .txt and .doc files or as .SRT subtitle "
"files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Convert videos from platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and X by "
"downloading the file directly, with an option to save the file for easy "
"access and future use."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Planned features:"
msgstr ""

msgid "We have several planned features in the pipeline, including:"
msgstr ""

msgid "- Translation of conversion results into multiple languages."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Spell check functionality with dictionaries."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Conversion of results into audio using text-to-speech engines."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Supported services:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The software currently only supports online conversion using Google's "
"speech recognition, OpenAi's Whisper, and Meta's wit.ai."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Important notes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Please take note of the following important information:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- By default, the program uses the Google service. To utilize other "
"services, you need to obtain an API key from the respective service "
"provider."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- For the best results with Arabic language transcription, we recommend "
"using wit.ai."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- OpenAI's Whisper has been included based on previous experiences, but "
"it may not function as intended or may not work at all. We appreciate "
"your feedback and experiences to help us resolve any issues."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Unlike OpenAI, Wit.ai provides free API keys."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- When converting a file, ensure that you select the appropriate language"
" before initiating the conversion process. If a file is multilingual, "
"words in languages other than the selected language may not be accurately"
" converted due to limitations of the services."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Prior to conversion, files are split into segments of up to 60 seconds,"
" depending on the limitations of each service. Consequently, some words "
"may be lost during this process. To achieve optimal results, we recommend"
" adjusting the segment duration based on the silence time, file length, "
"and segment duration allowed by each service."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- For optimal results with .srt files, we recommend selecting a short "
"duration, such as 5 seconds, for the segments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Sound Transcriber requires [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 "
"Redistributable X64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and "
"[Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable "
"X64.](https://aka.ms/highdpimfc2013x64enu) If the program does not work "
"for you, please use the previous links to download and install the "
"required files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Currently, Sound Transcriber supports the following languages: Arabic, "
"English, Spanish, French, Russian, Turkish, And Vietnamese."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Sound Transcriber is compatible with Windows 8 and above, but only in "
"64-bit systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Supported file extensions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sound Transcriber supports the following file extensions for conversion:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
".mp3, .wav, .aac, .flac, .oga, .opus, .mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov, .m4a, .ogg,"
" .ram, .rm, .wma, .wmv, .3gp, .flv."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Obtaining API Keys:"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Wit.ai:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If we were to include an API key within the program itself, it would "
"likely be blocked after widespread usage by multiple users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moreover, wit.ai provides distinct API keys for each language. This means"
" that you need to create an application in the desired language and "
"obtain its corresponding API key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, it is not feasible for us to gather API keys for all "
"languages since they vary based on individual preferences."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Therefore, we will provide you with instructions on how to obtain your "
"own private API key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although the following steps may appear extensive, they are "
"straightforward and only need to be completed once."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Open the [wit.ai website](https://wit.ai)"
msgstr ""

msgid "- Log in with your Meta account by clicking \"Continue with Meta.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Follow the normal account creation steps or press \"Continue with "
"Facebook\""
msgstr ""

msgid "- Go to the top of the page, press h or 1 for screen reader users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Click \"New App\" and give the app any English name, such as test or my"
" app."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- You will find an options box for the app's language, open it and choose"
" the appropriate language. The audio files will be converted to the "
"language you choose."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Finally click \"Create\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Find the name of the application you created, click on it, and then "
"navigate to the \"Management\" button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- When you reach this button, press the letter b to find a button called "
"Settings. Press this button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Move with the number 4 or h for screen reader users until you find a "
"heading called Client Access Token, scroll down and you will find your "
"key as a button. You can select the text manually to copy it or press the"
" same button to for it to be automatically copied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Return to Sound Transcriber and paste your API key into the provided "
"field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can repeat these steps and create a new application with a different "
"name to obtain an API key for transcribing in another language. If you "
"want to use multiple languages with wit.ai, simply repeat the steps to "
"obtain an API key for each language."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Whisper:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sound Transcriber supports transcription through the use of OpenAI's "
"Whisper API keys, which are not available for free."

msgstr ""

msgid "## How to Translate:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While Sound Transcriber currently supports only a limited number of "
"languages in its interface options and user guide, it can transcribe "
"speech to text in a wide array of languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, we warmly welcome anyone interested in translating the program "
"into their native language."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Interface translation:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The translation of interface options primarily relies on .po files, which"
" can be edited using the Poedit program. You can download Poedit from its"
" official website, then navigate to the Sound Transcriber repository on "
"GitHub or locate the program folder on your device. Next, locate the "
"messages.pot file and open it in Poedit. From there, you can translate "
"the strings into your preferred language, save the file (which will "
"generate both a .po and a .mo file), and share these files with us."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Test translation:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sound Transcriber can recognize and accommodate new translations, "
"allowing you to test your translation before submitting it to us. To do "
"this, navigate to the Languages folder, create a folder with the code for"
" your language (the first two letters of the language), then create a "
"subfolder named LC_MESSAGES, and place the .po and .mo files inside. "
"Don't forget to name the files as SoundTranscriber.po and "
"SoundTranscriber.mo."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Documentation translation:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While translation of the update log and user guide is not mandatory, you "
"can translate them into your language using .pot files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We use .md files to create .pot files, which we then send to translators."
" After that, we convert the .po files we receive from the translators "
"back into .md files and then into .html files to include with the "
"program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This allows us to make corrections to any part of the manual and "
"changelog, ensuring they are applied consistently across all supported "
"languages. It also ensures that files in different languages remain in "
"exactly the same format and structure."
msgstr ""

msgid "To translate files, follow these steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Get the .pot files from the repository on GitHub or from the "
"Documentation folder in the Sound Transcriber directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Translate them using Poedit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- You may find some phrases repeated with additional periods. We use this"
" to distinguish between phrases, ensuring they stay in the correct "
"positions. Add the same number of periods, and we will remove them when "
"incorporating the translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Note that the texts may not appear in the correct order if the "
"translation is incomplete. Once translated correctly, reopen the file to "
"view them in the correct order."
msgstr ""

msgid "- Finally, share your files with us."
msgstr ""

msgid "### notes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- If you choose not to translate the User Guide and Updates file, Sound "
"Transcriber will display them in English."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Software translation is an ongoing effort, and we will liaise with you "
"before releasing new updates so you can translate any new content."
msgstr ""
